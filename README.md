Here are the steps that must be performed before running the R script:

1. Download the zip file from this URL.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Move ALL of the following files to the SAME DIRECTORY as the R script: features.txt
    subject_train.txt
    subject_test.txt
    X_train.txt
    X_test.txt
    y_train.txt
    y_test.txt
    
Once those steps are complete, you can run the R script (run_analysis.R)

The output of the R script is a tidy data set, tidy.csv
